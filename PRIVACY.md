# Privacy Policy for Compose Booster

**Last Updated:** December 7, 2025

## Overview

Compose Booster is an AI-powered email composition assistant developed by Cold Ray Labs. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how the app handles your data.

## Data Collection and Storage

### What We Store Locally

Compose Booster stores the following data **locally on your device only**:

- **API Key**: Your OpenRouter API key is stored encrypted on your local machine using a machine-derived encryption key. This key never leaves your device except when making API requests.
- **Preferences**: Your app settings (theme, font size, window position, etc.)
- **Custom Configurations**: Any custom prompts, tones, or quick actions you create
- **Usage Statistics**: Basic usage counts and estimated costs (stored locally only)

### What We Do NOT Collect

- We do not collect personal information
- We do not track your usage remotely
- We do not store your email content
- We do not use analytics or tracking services
- We do not share any data with third parties (except OpenRouter for processing, as described below)

## Third-Party Services

### OpenRouter API

When you process an email through Compose Booster, your email content is sent to [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) for AI processing. This is necessary to provide the core functionality of the app.

- **What is sent**: Your email draft text and the selected prompt/tone instructions
- **What is NOT sent**: Your API key is sent only as an authentication header, not in the request body
- **Data retention**: Please refer to [OpenRouter's Privacy Policy](https://openrouter.ai/privacy) for information about how they handle data

We recommend reviewing OpenRouter's privacy policy and terms of service before using Compose Booster.

## Data Security

- Your API key is encrypted using a machine-derived key unique to your computer
- All communication with OpenRouter uses HTTPS encryption
- No data is transmitted to Cold Ray Labs or any other party

## Your Rights

Since all your data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over it:

- **Access**: Your configuration is stored in your user app data folder
- **Delete**: Uninstalling the app or deleting the app data folder removes all stored data
- **Export**: You can export your settings (excluding API key) from the Settings > Advanced tab

## Children's Privacy

Compose Booster is not directed at children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document and in the app's release notes.
