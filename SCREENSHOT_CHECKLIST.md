Hi John,

I wanted to follow up on our meeting last week. I think we should move forward with the project but I'm not sure about the timeline. Can we discuss? Also the budget might be an issue.

Let me know when works for you.

Thanks

Hi John,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with me last week. I wanted to follow up on our discussion regarding the project.

After reviewing our conversation, I believe we should proceed with the initiative. However, I'd like to discuss two key considerations:

Timeline - I want to ensure we establish realistic milestones that align with our team's capacity.

Budget - There may be some constraints we need to address before moving forward.

Would you be available for a brief call this week to discuss these points? I'm flexible and happy to work around your schedule.

Best regards,
Sarah
